            <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

            <p>
                These Terms & Conditions apply to all purchases made through
                <strong>Cinema Quad Posters</strong>.
                By placing an order, you agree to the terms outlined below.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-divider"></div>

            <h5>Products</h5>

            <p>
                All items offered for sale are original British cinema quad posters unless otherwise stated.
                Posters are sold as collectible items and may show signs of age or prior handling.
                We aim to describe all posters accurately and provide clear images to assist buyers.
                Due to the nature of vintage materials, minor imperfections may be present and do not necessarily
                constitute faults.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-divider"></div>

            <h5>Pricing & availability</h5>

            <p>
                All prices are listed in pounds sterling (£).
                Prices and availability are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to withdraw any item from sale at any time
                and to refuse an order where necessary.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-divider"></div>

            <h5>Orders & payment</h5>

            <p>
                Orders are placed through the website checkout and payment is processed securely via PayPal.
                A PayPal account is not required to pay by debit or credit card. Orders will not be dispatched until payment has been received in full.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-divider"></div>

            <h5>Shipping & delivery</h5>

            <p>
                Posters are shipped using tracked and insured postal services.
                Packaging is designed to protect items during transit. Estimated delivery times are provided as guidance only and are not guaranteed,
                particularly for international orders.
            </p>

            <p>
                Responsibility for an order passes to the customer once the item has been dispatched.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-divider"></div>

            <h5>Loss or damage in transit</h5>

            <p>
                All shipments are insured to the appropriate value.
                In the unlikely event that an item is lost or damaged in transit,
                claims will be handled in accordance with the terms of the postal service used.
                Customers must notify us as soon as possible if an order arrives damaged
                or fails to arrive.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-divider"></div>

            <h5>Returns</h5>

            <p>
                Returns are accepted within 7 days of delivery,
                provided the item is returned in the same condition in which it was received. Return postage costs are the responsibility of the customer unless the item is faulty
                or incorrectly supplied.
                We recommend using a tracked and insured postal service for all returns.
                We cannot issue refunds for items that return damaged or not received.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-divider"></div>

            <h5>Refunds</h5>

            <p>
                Refunds will be issued once a returned item has been received and inspected.
                Original shipping costs are non-refundable unless the return is due to our error.
            </p>
