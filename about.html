            <h1>About Cinema Quad Posters</h1>

            <p>
                Cinema Quad Posters specialises in <strong>carefully selected original British cinema quad posters</strong> -
                produced exclusively for UK cinema exhibition and never sold through retail outlets. Because of their limited 
                print runs, distinctive landscape format, and often unique artwork,
                British quads have become increasingly sought after by collectors worldwide.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-divider"></div>

            <h5>What we look for</h5>

            <p>
                We focus on posters that are in the best possible condition for their age.
                Modern quad posters that are heavily creased, badly damaged, or poorly stored are not acquired.
                Where possible, posters are photographed in high resolution and described honestly,
                allowing collectors to assess condition clearly before purchasing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pricing is set to be comparable with — or lower than — other established quad poster dealers,
                while recognising that some posters are naturally more desirable than others.
                That variation is part of the pleasure of collecting, shaped by individual taste as much as rarity.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-divider"></div>

            <h5>What is a British cinema quad poster?</h5>

            <p>
                The British cinema quad (quadruple crown) poster has been the UK standard since the late 1930s.
                Measuring 30 × 40 inches and printed in landscape format,
                quads differ significantly from their US one-sheet counterparts. Because of this unique orientation, 
                artwork for imported American films often had to be redesigned
                or completely re-commissioned for the UK market.
                This led to alternative artwork — frequently more imaginative and visually striking than the original US designs —
                and has made many British quads highly collectible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Up until the mid-1980s, quad posters were typically machine-folded
                and printed on heavier matte paper stock.
                From the early 1990s onwards, most modern quads have been printed double-sided on gloss paper,
                designed for display in illuminated cinema lightboxes.
            </p>

            <div class="legal-divider"></div>

            <h5>Modern releases & reissues</h5>

            <p>
                While contemporary releases rarely commission alternative UK artwork,
                distributors such as Park Circus and the BFI have helped reinvigorate the quad poster format
                by reissuing classic films with newly designed artwork for theatrical screenings. 
                These modern quads, while visually striking, are often more delicate and harder to restore
                than their earlier counterparts — something we take into account when selecting stock.
            </p>

            <h5>A simpler website, built with care</h5>

            <p>
                In January 2026, we launched a completely new website, rebuilt and designed from the ground up with a deliberate focus on clarity and speed, making it
                <strong>faster, simpler, and more intuitive</strong> to use - particularly on mobile devices.
                The new design has been kept intentionally minimal to allow pages to load quickly, images to display clearly,
                and the browsing experience to remain calm and distraction-free.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many poster images have been photographed at higher resolution,
                and over time we will continue to re-photograph older listings where improved detail is needed.
                The site will continue to evolve, but always with the same priority:
                a clean, reliable, and enjoyable way to discover and collect British cinema quad posters.
                If you ever notice an error or inconsistency, please let us know —
                the site is very much a living project.
            </p>
